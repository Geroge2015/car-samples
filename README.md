Car Samples Repository
==================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get started
writing apps for the car.

The samples are broken into two folders/categories:
- Android Auto - Driver-optimized app experience for users with an Android phone and an
Android Auto-compatible car. The experience appears on the car's head unit but is powered
by the connected Android phone.

- Android Automotive OS - Android-based infotainment system that is built in to vehicles.
The car's system is a stand-alone Android device that is optimized for driving.
